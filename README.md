## Description
A program that iterates through pictures in a folder, automatically changing your Steam profile picture every ~40 seconds. 

Iteration can be done randomly or linearly, random will choose any image in the folder as long as it isn't the current profile picture, whereas linear allows for—admittedly rather slow—animation.

# Requirements
* Steam
* Internet connection
* The .pyw *should*—mostly—run on either Windows or Linux, assuming you have python and `requirements.txt` installed; I haven't tested it on anything but Windows though, so open an [issue](https://github.com/AdamWHY2K/Simply_Switch_Steam_Profile_Picture/issues/new) if it doesn't.
* I'd recommend just using the .exe if you're on Windows.

# Installation
* Download a [release](https://github.com/AdamWHY2K/Simply_Switch_Steam_Profile_Picture/releases).
* Extract.
* Place your profile pictures into the `images` folder.
* Open `settings.inc`.
* Find your Steam64ID [here](https://www.steamidfinder.com/) and enter it into `settings.inc`.
* Ensure you are logged into steam on your browser.
* Run `SSS_PFP.exe` or `SSS_PFP.pyw`.

# If you have any issues please first check `SSS_PFP.log`, then ensure the values in `settings.inc` are correct and that you are logged in to Steam via your browser, then open an [issue](https://github.com/AdamWHY2K/Simply_Switch_Steam_Profile_Picture/issues/new).
